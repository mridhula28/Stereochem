    "The aim of this project was the visualisation and analysis of organic molecules. In this context, the relative reactivity of molecules and their respective active sites seemed an interesting feature to analyze. Electrophilicity and nucleophilicity are fundamental concepts in organic chemistry that describe the reactivity of molecules. Electrophilicity refers to the ability of a molecule or ion to accept an electron pair, making it an electron-loving species (electrophile). Electrophiles typically have a positive charge, partial positive charge, or an electron-deficient atom, making them attracted to electron-rich regions. On the other hand, nucleophilicity describes the ability of a molecule or ion to donate an electron pair, making it an electron-rich species (nucleophile). Nucleophiles are usually negatively charged or have lone pairs of electrons, such as anions, amines, and alcohols. The interaction between nucleophiles and electrophiles drives many chemical reactions, particularly in organic synthesis, where nucleophiles attack electrophiles to form new bonds."
